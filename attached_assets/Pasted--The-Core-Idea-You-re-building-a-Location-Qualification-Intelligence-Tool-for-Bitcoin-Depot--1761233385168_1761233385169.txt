üß† The Core Idea

You‚Äôre building a Location Qualification & Intelligence Tool for Bitcoin Depot (BD) ‚Äî a simple, smart web app that helps you instantly determine if a specific retail location is qualified to host a Bitcoin ATM (BTM).

As an SDR (Sales Development Representative) or site scout, your goal is to identify which stores are worth contacting and pitching for BTM placement. Right now, you and your colleagues do that manually ‚Äî by checking each address on Google Maps, looking up population density on sites like UnitedStatesZipCodes.org, checking for nearby BD or competitor BTMs, confirming business type, and ensuring store hours match BD‚Äôs requirements.
This process is slow, repetitive, and prone to error.

This app automates all of that.

üíª The Application ‚Äî Overview

It‚Äôs a lightweight web application (HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS at first) that runs locally or online and does everything you do manually, but faster and more accurately.

üß© The Process ‚Äî Step by Step

When you paste an address (e.g. ‚Äú3136 Trawood Dr Suite 7.8, El Paso, TX 79936‚Äù), the app will:

1. Geocode the Address

It finds:

The exact location (latitude & longitude)

The ZIP code

The business name

This is done through a Geocoding API ‚Äî use Google Maps API since BD‚Äôs entire team already works within Google Maps‚Äô ecosystem.

2. Check Population Density (ZIP-level)

The app verifies if the ZIP code meets BD‚Äôs minimum population density requirement (will be set in the settings cog).

It can get this data from US  Census Bureau API, (535b5511899e2256fe179966adc31e2591c6aea2).

3. Check Nearby BTMs within 1 mile radues (Radius Search)

Next, it looks within 1 mile radues of that location to find:

Any existing Bitcoin Depot ATM (if yes ‚Üí not qualified)

Any competitor Bitcoin ATMs, and how many for each competitor


So, for example:

Within 1 mile:

Bitcoin Depot ATMs: 0

Competitor ATMs: 4 (2 CoinFlip, 1 RockItCoin, 1 CoinCloud)
‚úÖ Qualified for placement

4. Business Qualification

The app then checks the type of business, which it can automatically detect from Google Maps data.
If it belongs to one of the following tiers:

Tier 1 ($300):
Supermarkets
Grocery Stores
Convenience Stores

Tier 2 ($200):
Hispanic Markets
Smoke shop (this does not include dispensaries/cannabis stores)
Liquor store
Wireless stores (cell phone repair stores as well)
Check cashing
Currency exchange/money transfer
Pawn shops
Dollar/discount stores
Casinos
Pharmacies
Hotel
Gun stores
Jewelry stores
Local malls
Fast food, deli/cafes, and fast casual restaurants (no sit-down restaurants; you must order directly from the cashier)
Laundromat
Auto and hardware stores
Sporting goods stores
Bowling alleys
Large thrift stores
Local Shipping stores. Ie, local version of ups
Local¬†sneaker¬†store
auto supply store
bingo hall

‚úÖ It‚Äôs considered a valid target.

Otherwise:
‚ùå Automatically rejected.

5. Store Hours Check

The app verifies if the business is open:

At least 5 days a week (Mon‚ÄìFri)

For 9 hours/day minimum

If yes ‚Üí ‚úÖ Meets BD requirements.
If no ‚Üí ‚ùå Not qualified.
